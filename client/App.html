    <p>
      <b>What is this?</b> A service that gives you a static address/QR code in
      which you can receive tips, donations and stuff like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why?</b> Because if you're a street musician you don't want to stop
      your music to manually generate an invoice on your phone so people can tip
      you. You want a paper with a QR code printed on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Is this different from other tipping services?</b> Yes, because it uses
      <a
        href="https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/spec.md#4-lnurl-pay"
        >lnurl-pay</a
      >, a protocol that combines HTTPS and Lightning to deliver fantastic user
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>And it's also noncustodial?</b> Yes. Your node generates the invoices,
      we only deliver the lnurl-pay interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Which wallets support this? </b>
      See the
      <a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-lnurl#wallets">list here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How do I fill the form above?</b> Follow the placeholders. The formats
      are tricky but with a little patience you'll get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What is sparko?</b> A thin HTTP server on top of your c-lightning node.
      It runs
      <a
        href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lightningd-gjson-rpc/tree/master/cmd/sparko"
        >as a plugin</a
      >
      and you can create keys with fine-grained permissions and give them out to
      services (better than macaroons).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How do I use this with c-ligntning?</b> Install the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lightningd-gjson-rpc/tree/master/cmd/sparko"
        >sparko</a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lightningd-gjson-rpc/tree/master/cmd/lnurl"
        >lnurl</a
      >
      plugins and generate a key with a single permission:
      <code>+lnurlinvoice</code>, then paste it here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How do I get a Macaroon in hex format?</b>
      <code
        >xxd -ps -u -c 1000
        $HOME/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/invoices.macaroon</code
      >
      or ask someone to do it for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Which ports should I open in my router?</b>
      None. Try calling <em>ifconfig | grep inet6 | grep global</em> in your
      terminal. If you get a result that means you have a global IPv6 address
      and that's enough. Tell your lnd to listen at that address and paste it
      here. If your ISP isn't good enough to give you IPv6, proceed to the next
      question for more instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        >Does my node have to be exposed to the open internet for this to work?
        Does it need a public IPv4 address?</b
      >
      No, even if you don't have a public IPv4 or IPv6 you can still
      <a href="https://www.zerotier.com/download/">install ZeroTier</a> and
      connect to the public network <code>8056c2e21c000001</code>, then tell
      your API server to listen at the <code>2x.0.0.0</code> address you'll be
      assigned there. That's even safer than direct connection, as communication
      through ZeroTier is end-to-end encrypted on a lower layer.
    </p>
    <p><b>Can I print the QR code for my node?</b> Yes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>What is this TLS certificate thing?</b> If you're using a self-signed
      certificate for your Lightning server HTTP API you can paste here the
      contents of the <code>tls.cert</code> or <code>cert.pem</code> here so we
      can safely talk to your server. Just copy the entire file contents and
      paste it here. However this is all broken if your certificate isn't issued
      for the exact IP address you've set your node to listen on. Generally that
      isn't the case. If you don't specify the certificate tip.bigsun.xyz will
      connect to your node in a less safe manner, but still pretty good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why is this site so ugly?</b> We're waiting for a volunteer designer to
      show up.
